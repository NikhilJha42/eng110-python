# eng110-python

## This is a repository created for learning Python.

### Some basics:

- Variables are declared using `var_name = var_value`;
- Standard mathematical operators: `+` (add), `-`(subtract), `*`(multiply), `/`(divide), `^`(to the power of), `%` (modulo);
- Can update variables with `x = x + 1` (for example), or `x += 1`.

#### Variable types:
##### Integers and floats

- `int` and `float` variables are numbers;
- Numerically, `1` and `1.0` are equal, but behave slightly differently in Python when being used in a program.
